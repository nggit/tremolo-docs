# Basics
This section covers the basic functionality you need to build web applications with Tremolo. Most of the concepts are not new and you will find them familiar.

Tremolo uses the [app object](/tremolo-docs/reference/app/) as the starting point for everything. We avoid inheritance so you don't have to worry about "what should I import?" or other ridiculous requirements.

The interface is minimal, no-nonsense, yet powerful and should be more than enough to build even complex applications. Enjoy!
